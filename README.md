# FreezerCatalogAPI  ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/demian054/FreezerCatalogAPI.svg?branch=master) 

-Document version 0.1
 
### Tech Task
```
Create an app that publishes a REST API with methods as specified below. Write the API code and test cases, 
and document the code. You may use common frameworks if you wish. You will be asked to explain your choices.

Specification
The API is a service to create a catalog of the food in my freezer. The endpoints are

/food
	Method to add some food to the freezer, giving name, type & quantity; returns ID
	Method to provide an ID & get the detail of the food
	Method update an item
/food/search
	Method search for food by name, type or date added


All methods should be authenticated with an API key. Data can be stored in memory or a temporary database such 
as H2 so we can run it locally and test using Postman.

What you are expected to deliver
Documented source code
A working solution
Test cases
A brief summary of your implementation decisions and thoughts on possible enhancements & challenges

```
